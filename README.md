# utfr_perceptionmodel

NOTE: My main contributions are to the classical perception models, however I have been following closely and working alongside the deep learning perception team. As this is a design team, I will not take full credit for any of this code, it is always a team effort and this repo is just to showcase the products of our perception models.
